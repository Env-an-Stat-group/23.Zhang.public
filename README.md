Code for "High Resolution Global Precipitation Downscaling with Latent Gaussian Models and Nonstationary SPDE Structure" by Jiachen Zhang, Matthew Bonas, Diogo Bolster, Geir-Arne Fuglstad and Stefano Castruccio.

## Code
 This folder cantain code to run simulation study and application for latent Gaussian model. The models included stationary and nonstationary model with and without land/sea effect.

## Dataset
This folder include sample dataset that used to run nonstaionary latent Gaussian model with land/sea effect.
